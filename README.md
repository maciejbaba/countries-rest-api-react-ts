### Second version of countries project, this time created with React, Typescript and TailwindCSS instead of vanillaJS and standard CSS

Demo -> https://countries-rest-api-react-ts.vercel.app/

Overall I think it was easier, I mean I practiced React and TS plus Tailwind at once in this project so it wasn't as easy as it should be but the main functionalities of the app were much easier to implement for example:
rendering list of countries or rendering country component
applying CSS with Tailwind is just pleasure to work with

On the other hand getting proper TS types was kinda hard, especially setting types after drilling them from parent component but after figuring it out it happend to be pretty straight forward

I also now understand purpose of Redux (the need for global state in react) it's such a pain passing props to child and child of that child and so forth in order to be able to change state or something

So overall I think the project was easier to build and modern tools help (wow what a discovery)
